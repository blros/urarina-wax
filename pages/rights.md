### Traditional Knowledge (TK) Labels

TK Labels are an initiative for Indigenous communities and local organizations, created by the Local Contexts project. Developed through sustained partnership and testing within Indigenous communities across multiple countries, the Labels support the inclusion of local protocols for access and use of cultural heritage that is digitally circulating outside community contexts. TK labels offer an educative and informational strategy to help non-community users of this cultural heritage understand its significance to the communities from where it derives and continues to have meaning. TK Labels identify cultural material that has community-specific conditions regarding access and use. This includes sacred and/or ceremonial material, material that has gender restrictions, seasonal conditions of use and/or materials specifically designed for outreach purposes.  The TK Labels promote new standards of respect by embedding Indigenous rules and protocols within digital systems.
