For building this website the team adheres to the principles of minimal computing by using Jekyll as a platform and WAX as its theme. 

## Minimal computing
In order to spend more time on 
Minimal computing  advocates for using only the technologies that are necessary and sufficient for developing digital humanities scholarship.
## Jekyll
Jekyll is a static site generator (SSG) written and run on the RUBY programming language. Unless you are a developer no knowledge of RUBY is required. Jekyll is designed to create sites based on principles of minimal computing. The platform uses plain text files in markdown syntax to create HTML files. Thus, for the creation of simple sites no prior knowledge of HTML or CSS is needed. The generated HTML files can be deployed to a web server. Jekyll offers a variety of themes by means of which different types of websites can be created. 

The Urarina Digital Heritage Project is an digital collection exhibit for which the WAX Jekyll theme was employed. A collection site is a complex site, and even more so if it aims to be a trilingual site. Plug-ins help to to add functionality, hovever some developping sklills were needed at some point.

You can learn more about using Jekyll on the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) or in [this tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) by Amanda Visconti at Programming Historian.

## WAX
[Wax](https://minicomp.github.io/wax/) is a Jekyll theme. It depends on metadata created in a .csv sheet that records the data of a collection.

WAX has implemented Facets, a tool .....

To learn more about setting up and using Wax visit [the Wax wiki](https://minicomp.github.io/wiki/wax/).

 ### Facets
 Facets is a theme of WAX. As other WAX sites it depends on the .csv metadata sheet

As other Wax sites, _Facets_ depends on the metadata you create. Let's assume you are using a CSV to record data for your collection. In order for _Facets_ to work, that CSV must have designated columns for each large category you want to "facet" by. These become the _facet headers_ at the top of the drop-down menus above the gallery. Each of these columns then accepts a small range of sub-categories, or _facet values_. These become the check boxes.
